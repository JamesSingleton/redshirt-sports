            <description><![CDATA[D-II coaches help fill out McNeese State coaching staff]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[After hiring Gary Goff as their head coach on December 19th, they have been hard at work rounding out their staff.

Zach Barnett from FootballScoop reported that McNeese was set to hire their defensive coordinator from the FBS ranks. On December 29th, McNeese State announced that the former South Alabama quality control analyst, Tony Pecoraro, was joining McNeese State as their defensive coordinator after a single season at South Alabama. Prior to his time at South Alabama, he was the defensive coordinator for Southern Miss.

Joining Barnett on the staff will be a few familiar faces to head coach Gary Goff. After leading Valdosta State to the D-II championship game a few weeks ago, a majority of his staff is following him to McNeese State.

On the offensive side of things, Phillip Ely (QBs), Ryan Allgood (OL), Sean Fogarty (TEs), and Thomas Reese (RBs) have joined the staff from Valdosta State. They have also added wide receivers coach Felton Huggins to their staff who previously coached collegiately at Charleston Southern.

McNeese has announced the hiring of Marc Yellock (DL), Mike Johnson (DBs), Dwight Jackson (LBs) who are also following Goff from Valdosta to round out the defensive side of things. Furthermore, former defensive graduate assistant, Marco Sanchez, is being promoted to defensive assistant.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[George Quarles will replace Randy Sanders, who retired after the Bucs finished 11-2 this season]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ETSU has been on the hunt for their next head coach after Randy Sanders announced his retirement on December 13th. Some of the candidates to have been considered were ETSU’s defensive coordinator Billy Taylor, VMI’s head coach Scott Wachenheim, Furman’s offensive coordinator George Quarles, and Los Angeles Chargers wide receivers coach Chris Beatty.

George Quarles is expected to be announced as their new head coach during a press conference today during a welcome press on the ETSU campus in Johnson City, Tennessee. Quarles rewrote Tennessee record books as head coach of Maryville High School, going 250-16 in 18 seasons and winning 11 state championships.

Over the past five seasons, Quarles has been part of the staff at his alma mater, Furman University. While he was a player, he helped the Paladins to their only national championship in 1988. For the last four seasons, he has been Furman’s offensive coordinator helping them become one of the Southern Conference’s highest-scoring offenses.

Quarles will be taking charge of an ETSU team that went 11-2 this season and made their way to the FCS Playoffs quarterfinal before losing to North Dakota State 27-3. It will be interesting to see if Quarles brings Furman’s high powered up tempo offense to ETSU.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Following a first round bye, the home teams were able to win seven of the eight games this weekend.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The highlight of this weekend was ETSU's late rally scoring 14 points in the last 1:28 against Kennesaw St.

Friday Night

Villanova (10-2) 21, Holy Cross (10-3) 16

Holy Cross led the game in many stats categories but they could not stop Villanova from converting all three of their trips to the red zone. Holy Cross failed to convert a fourth down on their first possession of the game and ended the first half with a missed field goal.

Justin Covington rushed for two touchdowns and Jalen Jackson scored on the ground in the third quarter earning Villanova their coach Mark Ferrante his first playoff win in five seasons.

Montana (10-2) 57, Eastern Washington (10-3) 41

Eastern Washington was able to go into the half leading 21-20 but they could not stop Montana from going on a 30-7 run to begin the second half. Montana's defense was able to hold off EWU's Eric Barriere with Justin Ford getting a pick-six giving Justin his ninth of the season.

Saturday Night

ETSU (11-1) 32, Kennesaw State (11-2) 31

Kennesaw State was a 2.5 point favorite coming into this game; but they could not stop the Southern Conference champs from scoring 15 points in the final 1 minute and 28 seconds. Quay Holmes entered the game as the FCS leading rusher and had 87 yards on the ground with one touchdown and 95 yards receiving with two touchdowns.

James Madison (11-1) 59, Southeastern Louisiana (9-4) 20

This game was not the game we thought it would be lighting up the scoreboard left and right. JMU showed off their FCS-best plus-21 turnover margin forcing Southeastern to turn the ball over five times.

North Dakota State (11-1) 38, Southern Illinois (8-5) 7

North Dakota State controlled the matchup with their ground game, carrying the ball 62 times for 389 yards and five touchdowns. This win helped North Dakota State improve to 29-1 in FCS playoff games at home.

Sam Houston (11-0) 49, UIW (10-3) 42

The defending FCS champions had to overcome three different deficits and break a 42-42 tie to secure their 22nd straight win since 2019. UIW's Cameron Ward passed for 481 yards and five touchdowns, thankfully Sam Houston was able to control the clock with 48 carries and 346 rushing yards.

Montana State (10-2) 26, UT Martin (10-3) 7

Montana State was able to put the distraction of their starting quarterback Matthew McKay announcing he was entering the transfer portal with less than 48 hours before the game. Behind their new starter Tommy Mellott, Montana State was able to out gain UT Martin 438 yards to 178 yards.

South Dakota State (10-3) 24, Sacramento State (9-3) 19

The Jackrabbits were the only unseeded road team to win in the second round. Isaiah Davis rushed for two touchdowns in the first half helping South Dakota build a 24-0 first-half lead. South Dakota was able to stop Sacramento State's comeback despite allowing 480 yards of offense.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The 2021 FCS playoffs semifinals are set.



On Friday at 8:15 p.m. CT No. 2 North Dakota State will host No. 3 James Madison which will air on ESPN2. Between these two FCS giants, the Bison have won eight national titles since 2010 and JMU has appeared in the 2016, 2017, and 2019 championship games but only winning a national title in 2016.



James Madison will bring one of the nations top defenses into Fargo, trying to slow down a North Dakota State offense that ran all over East Tennessee State for 278 yards. If they can stop NDSU's which averaged 382 rushing yards and scored 16 touchdowns during the month of November, they might just have a chance.



Unseeded South Dakota State heads to No. 8 Montana State this Saturday for a 1 p.m. CT game aired on ESPN2. South Dakota has risen to one of the top FCS programs, making the FCS playoffs in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2021. The Jacks lost to Sam Houston 23-21 in the 2021 spring national championship game. Their opponent, Montana State, just beat that Sam Houston team 42-19 in a absolutely dominant fashion.



Montana State will need to slow down Isaiah Davis and if healthy Pierre Strong Jr. Strong has rushed for 1,578 yards and 17 touchdown which makes him the nation's top rusher in the FCS right above Quay Holmes of ETSU. Is MSU can stop the run and keep the momentum from their victory over No. 1 Sam Houston, this game could turn into a highlight reel.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[New Orleans native, and long time LSU assistant resigns from McNeese State.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[On Tuesday, Brian Kelly announced he has hired Frank Wilson as associate head coach for LSU.



This moved stunned many in Lake Charles as Frank Wilson joined McNeese State in January of 2020 after spending four seasons as the head coach at UTSA. Frank Wilson made history at the time of his hiring as the first African-American head football coach in McNeese State history and the second in the history of the Southland Conference. He led them to a 7-11 overall record with five loses coming by ten points or less.



Wilson previously spent six years on the LSU staff as running backs coach and recruiting coordinator. During his time there, LSU had four Top 10 recruiting classes, including the No. 2 class in 2014 and No. 5 class in 2015. Furthermore, LSU appeared in six bowl games including the 2012 BCS National Championship game and the 2011 SEC Championship as well as posted a 61-17 overall record while Wilson was a member of the LSU staff.



Brian Kelly is looking to tap into Wilson's recruiting prowess as he has been recognized twice as the national recruiter of the year. Wilson is responsible for recruiting players to LSU such as Odell Beckham Jr., Jarvis Landry, Leonard Fournette, and the list goes on. ]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[This match is a little surprising as South Dakota State is there as an unseeded team and Montana State is hosting despite being the last of the playoff's eight seeded teams.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the fourth time in the last five seasons that South Dakota State has reached the semifinals. For them to get back to the champsionship game they will need to make it through a tough 11-2 Montana State that is coming off a a huge win against defending national champions Sam Houston. 



The Bobcats have only lost one FCS game this year and are on an 11 game home winning streak. Overall they are 20-2 at home since 2018 and this game has been sold out since Tuesday. Although the Jacks are good on the road, going into Villanova and Sacramento State is a completely different than going into Bobcat Stadium.



Both teams boast a strong offensive line and have the number six and number eight ranked rushing game in the FCS. The Jacks are coming off the best 30 minutes of football all season outscoring Villanova 21-0 in the second half in route to a 35-21 win. 



SDSU will look to run the ball with Davis and if available, Pierre Strong who left the last game with a concusion and will be a game-time decision. If they get their dynamic duo back and are able to stop Montana State on offense, SDSU could have a good chance at pulling out a victory in Bobcat Stadium.



For the Bobcats, the offense has rallied around Tommy Mellot who has 8 rushing tochdowns and threw 2 touchdowns against Sam Houston. Adding to Mellot's rushing is Isaiah Ifanse who has rushed for over 1,500 yards this season. If Montana State can keep position and utilize their number two ranked scoring defense, expect this game to be a blowout like Sam Houston.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Cosh has been a huge part of VMI's offensive success over the past two seasons.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[After two successful seasons as Virginia Military Institute's offensive coordinator, Billy Cosh has been named the offensive coordinator for The University of Richmond.

Cosh took over as offensive coordinator for the Keydets after Brian Sheppard left for the University of Minnesota after the 2019 season. However, VMI did not play in the fall of 2020 due to the pandemic, so Cosh's first season as an offensive coordinator at any level was during the spring semester season.

Under Cosh's guidance of the VMI offense for the past two seasons, VMI saw its first winning season since 1981, captured the Southern Conference title, and their first ever berth in the FCS Playoffs. VMI's offense ranked 20th in the nation in scoring offense (29.2), 18th in passing efficiency (144.77), 17th in total offense (427.6 yards), 9th in passing offense (309.4 yards), and 5th in first downs (201).

In addition to his role as offensive coordinator, Cosh also served as the quarterbacks coach guiding two Keydet quartbacks to honors during the spring season. Reece Udinski earned Second Team All-Conference for his play prior to suffering a torn ACL. Redshirt freshman, Seth Morgan, stepped in mid-season and did not miss a beat, earning Southern Conference Freshman of the Year honors. Seth Morgan ended the season second in the nation with a 71.3 completion percentage and ninth with a 153.5 passing efficiency.

In the fall season, the Keydets and Cosh finished 6-5, which marked VMI's second straight winning season. The Keydets continued to light up the scoreboard ranking 32nd in the nation in scoring (31.3), 26th in total offense (417.9 yards), 25th in passing offense (256.9 yards), and 15th in first downs (253). ]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Number two ranked North Dakota State will face number eight ranked Montana State for the 2021 FCS championship on Jan. 8 in Frisco, Texas. ]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Bison will be looking for their ninth title in ten years whereas the Bobcats will attempting to to win their second title in program history. The last time Montana State won a title was back in 1984 defeating Louisiana Tech 19-6 whereas the last time North Dakota State won was back in 2019 when they beat JMU 28-20. This will be the third time these two teams have met in the FCS playoffs with the Bison winning each contest by a considerable margin.

North Dakota State's Path to the Championship

After going 10-1 in the regular season the Bison earned themselves a first round bye and the second overall seed. Their first game in this years playoffs was a 38-7 victory over the Southern Illinois Salukis behind a two touchdown performance from their running back TaMerik Williams.

In the quarterfinals they faced the East Tennessee State Buccaneers and beat them in dominate fashion 27-3. Cam Miller threw for 123 yards and Williams rushed for two touchdowns.

The Bison went on to defeat James Madison University in the semifinals 20-14 with a two touchdown performance from Miller and a 199-yard, two touchdown day for fullback Hunter Luepke.

Montana State's Path to the Championship

Just like the Bison, the Bobcats also earned a first round bye after going 9-2 in the regular season. Tommy Mellot, who stepped in for transferring quarterback Matthew McKay, had a 181 yard and two touchdown rushing performance to beat the Tennessee-Martin Skyhawks 26-7.

The Bobcats went on to dominate the defending FCS champions Sam Houston State 42-7. Once again Tommy Mellot put on a show throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for two more.

Montana State kept the momentum going in the semifinals against South Dakota State with a 31-17 victory. Tommy Mellot threw for two touchdowns and rushed for one more.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[One of the most well known FCS stats is NDSU's 30-1 record at home in the playoffs.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Friday night marks a battle of two FCS powerhouses in James Madison University and North Dakota State University. NDSU is the No. 2 seed and has won eight FCS titles since 2010 and plays host to the No. 3 seed JMU which is the only team to beat NDSU at home during the playoffs, doing so in 2016. Both schools met in the championship game in 2017 and 2019.

This obviously isn't the first time these two have met, but it will be their last as JMU is transitioning to the FBS after this season. Leaving the FCS with a title would be a storybook ending to JMU season and time in the FCS. On the other hand, NDSU defeating another team moving up a subdivision, a level in which NDSU currently has no realistic path to, would be a bittersweet feeling.

The Bison rank second in rushing averaging 281.3 yards per game. However, after losing to South Dakota State (also in the semifinals), they have rushed for over 300 yards per game against their last four opponents. TaMerik Williams has settled into the main ball carrier for the Bison even though they spread the ball around in the backfield.

The Dukes are fourth in the FCS in stopping the run and rank seventh in scoring defenses only allowing 15.1 points per game. Helping JMU limit rushers to only 82.5 yards a game in their big defensive line. Mike Green who stands 6-foot-3 and weighs 293 pounds is one of the top interior lineman in the FCS. Combined with their edge rushers Bryce Carter and Isaac Ukwu and linebacker Diamonte Tucker-Dorsey, NDSU's o-line could be in for a difficult battle in the trenches.

JMU ranks sixteenth in the FCS with 281.4 yards passing and will be matched up against a Bison defense that is ranked tenth in pass defense, allowing only 174.5 yards per game. The Dukes will need to rely on Cole Johnson to play at a high level again as he is done all season. He will have two huge weapons available to him at the wide receiver position in Antwane Wells Jr. (78 catches for 1,197 yards and 14 touchdowns) and Kris Thornton (77 catches for 1,050 yards and 13 touchdowns). This dynamic duo is the first to both reach 1,000 yards receiving in the same season.

Cole Johnson and the JMU offense will look to exploit NDSU's young cornerbacks. This will be the first time all season they have faced elite receivers. Wells and Thornton are great route-runners, have great hands, and are dangerous after the catch. If JMU's o-line can hold up against NDSU and keep Johnson comfortable, look for them to take deep shots most of the game.

            <description><![CDATA[VMI’s Scott Wachenheim is promoting wide receivers coach Patrick Ashford to offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Early this month we reported that former VMI offensive coordinator Billy Cosh was leaving to fill the same role at Richmond University. That left VMI with a huge hole to fill and they found their man in Wide Receivers coach Patrick Ashford.


Patrick was a backup quarterback at the University of Tennessee and starting holder. Before coming to VMI, he coached at the University of Tennessee at Martin before a two year stint at Austin Peay State as well as Vanderbilt.


Ashford played a crucial role in VMI’s 2020 season in which they played in the spring of 2021. VMI’s offense broke multiple school records which culminated in their first ever playoff berth and their first winning season since 1981. He also helped coach wide receiver Jakob Herres to All-American and top SoCon honors.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Earning a seed in the FCS playoffs is a big deal for teams. It gives the top eight teams a bye week and guarantees home-field advantage in the second round.



Kennesaw State at #7 ETSU

Going into this matchup, Kennesaw State is actually favored by 2.5 points. Kennesaw has the deffense to keep ETSU's Quay Holmes and Jacob Saylors at bay. This will be the closest contest in the second round in a battle of the trenches.

Southeastern Lousiana at #3 James Madison

SLU's Cole Kelley is a mobile QB who is going to look to take advantage of JMU's secondary. This game has the potential to light up the scoreboard, but don't expect an upset at JMU.

Holy Cross at #5 Villanova

Holy Cross' defense can turn games into an ugly low-scoring game that causes the opposing team's offense to not find their rhythm. However, Villanova would have to play its worst game of the year in order to lose this one.



UT Martin at #8 Montana State

Some would call UT Martin the sleeper of the first round and proved everyone wrong by winning against Missouri State. However, Montana State is not Missouri State, they are a more physical and disciplined team. UT Martin would need to overcome a lot in order to pull this upset.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Deion Sanders kept telling people that he was going to shock everyone come National Signing day.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[A day after being named the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year, Deion Sanders flipped the nation's No. 1 recruit in the class of 2022 in Travis Hunter from his commit to Florida State (Deion Sanders' alma mater) to an FCS program in Jackson State.



Travis is a five star cornerback/ wide receiver from Collins Hill High School in Suwanee, GA. Scouts have made comparisons of him to Pro Football Hall of Famer Charles Woodson for his ability to play both offense and defense.



The fact that Travis wants to play both receiver and cornerback at the next level and Deion Sanders willing to let him play both was probably a huge draw for him. Combine that with the opportunity to be coached by Deion Sanders being one of the best to ever play both sides of the ball, Jackson State is starting to become a powerhouse at the FCS level going 11-1 this past season.



Hunter said this on his decision to choose JSU over FSU:

Florida State has always been a beacon for me. I grew up down there, that's where my roots are, and I never doubted that I would play for the Seminoles. It's a dream that is hard to let go, but sometimes we are called to step into a bigger future than the one we imagined for ourselves. For me that future is at Jackson State University.



Travis Hunter is the first ever five star recruit to sign with an FCS school since the star rating came out in 2006. I believe this is ground breaking for FCS programs around the country, not just those coached by NFL legends. In signing Travis, it put FCS schools, especially HBCU, on the map as an attractive destination for recruits.



Other than this big signing, JSU also signed six players from the transfer portal:

Mark Pope ( 6-1, 175, WR, University of Miami)

Michael Pleas (6-3, 222, S, Southern Miss)

Jason Mercier (6-5, 235, Edge, Florida International University)

Evan Henry (6-3, 315, OG, Louisiana-Monroe)

Jordyn Williams (6-1, 184, WR, Indiana)

Camron Buckley (6-2, 198, WR, Indiana)]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[No. 7 ETSU faces off against No. 2 NDSU who is headed back home after beating Southern Illinois on the road.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[East Tennesse State put together an impressive comeback to overcome a two touchdown deffecit with less than 1:30 to play. It took a frantic rally which included a successful onside kick and a go-ahead two-point conversion which propelled ETSU into this FCS quarterfinals matchup. To say that ETSU is this weekend's biggest underdog would be an understatement.

North Dakota State has an offense that routinely bullies their FCS counterparts. One of their biggest strengths is outscoring their opponents 87-7 off of turnovers. Their offense is led by quarterback Cam Miller who moves the offense roughly 7.1 yards per play. If Christian Watson is able to play this game after missing last week's game due to a hamstring injury, ETSU's first game against a Missouri Valley Conference opponent is going to make all the more challenging. Furthermore, NDSU is 6-0 all time against Souther Conference opponents.

ETSU will need to lean heavily on Walter Payton Award finalist Quay Holmes to control the ball and the clock. The longer ETSU can keep the Bison offense on the sidelines, the higher their chances of leaving Fargo, ND with a 'W'. Quay Holmes and Jacob Saylors combine for just shy of 300 all-purpose yards per game which no other set of FCS players combine for. However, the Bison defense is allowing just 83.1 rushing yards per game.

NDSU is known to quickly smother teams going into half-time with a substantial lead. However, ETSU have posted an FCS high five wins when trailing in the fourth quarter.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[After weeks of not scoring above 30 points a game and their then starting quarterback Matthew McKay entering the transfer portal, Montana State lit up the scoreboard anyway possible. In his second career start, quarterback Tommy Mellott had a hand in five touchdowns helping lead the No. 8 Montana State Bobcats to a 41-19 victory over No. 1 Sam Houston. 



With this victory, Montana State handed Sam Houston its first postseason loss at its stadium, as well as their first loss in 23 games. It is also the first time the top seed has not reached the semifinals since the FCS playoffs were expanded to 24 teams.



Montana State scored on its first drive of the game with a trick play similar to the philly special with wide receiver Willi Patterson throwing a 4-yard touchdown pass to Tommy Mellot. Later in the first quarter, the Bobcats took a 14-0 lead after an interception by Tre Webb which setup another Mellot-Patterson connection. Montana State would score 28 unanswered points before Sam Houston could even answer. 



The Bobcats put on a well balanced performance along with the most points they have scored in two months and are now a game away from reach the national championships. They will need to be firing on all cylinders to beat a South Dakota State team that is coming off a 35-21 victory over Villanova.]]></content:encoded>
